 * `size` is the rendered height of the whole 24-unit viewBox. Measuring the

 * padding and a 20-unit cap height on a shared baseline, so one `size` sets them
 * all at the same type size and the widths differ only because the names do —
 * "Anthropic" is longer than "xAI" for the same reason it is in running text.
 *
 * Cap height is therefore `size * 20 / 24`, but matching that to the cap height
 * of the neighbouring text overshoots badly: the marks are drawn bold, so at
 * equal cap height they carry far more weight than the regular-weight model name
 * above them and take over the card. They replace a 10px uppercase label, and
 * that is the size they want to be:
 *
 *   detail page  size 13 → 11px cap, under a 24px title
 *   card         size 11 →  9px cap, under a 16px model name
 *   card compact size  9 →  8px cap
 *
 * Upstream's docs demo these at `size={56}`, which is a showcase size: alone on
 * a white page, nothing to be subordinate to.
